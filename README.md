## Quick Setup Instructions

**Local Deploy**
1. Install the edition of Node.js appropriate to your device from [this archive link](https://nodejs.org/dist/v8.11.4/). If you have a more recent version of Node.js installed already, it may be worth reverting to the 8.11.4 version to ensure compatibility.
2. In the root directory `/ChemQuizGen/` run the terminal command `npm link`. (If you receive an error,
  ensure `package-lock.json` does not previously exist.)
3. Going forward, you will be able to use the command `ng serve` to start up a live development server of this web application
on your computer at http://localhost:4200/.

**GitHub Pages**
1. To update GitHub Pages within Master branch use `Npm run -script ghubuild`. this command will update the Doc folder which is associated with GitHub Pages.

**Heroku**
 1. To trigger a new push to Heroku, build the website locally using `ng build`, verify it works, and then `git push heroku master`.

## Primary Installation Instructions:

Make sure that you do this on every new computer that you are going to be developing on, or running the source code from, as it is necessary to run many of the commands that we use.

1. Go to https://nodejs.org/dist/v8.11.4/
2. Download the version that is for your device.
3. install that version of Node.js

This is needed to allow our backend and front end to work and work together.  This is the version that we built around, so if something isn't working, try reverting to this version.
