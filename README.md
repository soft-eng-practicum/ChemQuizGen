## Quick Setup Instructions
1. Install the edition of Node.js appropriate to your device from [this archive link](https://nodejs.org/dist/v8.11.4/). If you have a more recent version of Node.js installed already, it may be worth reverting to the 8.11.4 version to ensure compatability.
2. In the root directory `/ChemQuizGen/`run the terminal command `npm link`. (If you receive an error, ensure `package-lock.json`does not previously exist.)
3. Going forward, you will be able to use the commands `npm run dev`and `ng serve`to start up the back- and front-end divisions of this web application at http://localhost:4200/.

## Primary Installation Instructions:

Make sure that you do this on every new computer that you are going to be developing on, or running the source code from, as it is necessary to run many of the commands that we use.

1. Go to https://nodejs.org/dist/v8.11.4/
2. Download the version that is for your device.
3. install that version of Node.js

This is needed to allow our backend and front end to work and work together.  This is the version that we built around, so if something isn't working, try reverting to this version.
