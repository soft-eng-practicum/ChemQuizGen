## Quick Setup Instructions
1. Install the edition of Node.js appropriate to your device from [this archive link](https://nodejs.org/dist/v8.11.4/). If you have a more recent version of Node.js installed already, it may be worth reverting to the 8.11.4 version to ensure compatability.
2. [Setting up the backend.](https://github.com/soft-eng-practicum/ChemQuizGen/tree/master/ChemGenApp/BackEnd) Run the following commands in a terminal window in your `ChemQuizGen\ChemGenApp\BackEnd` directory:
   - `npm install babel-cli@6.26.0`
   - `npm install babel-preset-env@1.7.0`
   - `npm install babel-watch@2.0.7`
   - `npm install express@4.16.3`
   - `npm install cors@2.8.4`
   - All backend components should now have been successfully installed through Node.js' package manager "npm". To run a local development server, run the command `npm run dev` in a terminal window in this directory. Accessing the development server is done by navigating to `localhost:4000` in your web browser of choice.

## Primary Installation Instructions:

Make sure that you do this on every new computer that you are going to be developing on, or running the source code from, as it is necessary to run many of the commands that we use.

1. Go to https://nodejs.org/dist/v8.11.4/
2. Download the version that is for your device.
3. install that version of Node.js

This is needed to allow our backend and front end to work and work together.  This is the version that we built around, so if something isn't working, try reverting to this version.
